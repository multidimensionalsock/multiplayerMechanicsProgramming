writ about - mechanics development

fire bolt - the human player can fire a projectile now which can be used to burn plants when it collides to get through different areas. 
stand on moving platform 
pushable objects - there is now objects which can be pushed by the player that will be used to put pressure on buttons and things such as that in the puzzle. I'm still wondering whether this should be a human only ability or have it be for both the cat and human.
